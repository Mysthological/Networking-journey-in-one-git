If so, it reserves them and forwards   the reservation request to the next router.</p> </li> <li> <p>once all routers have confirmed the reservation, the receiver is notified, and the application can begin transmitting data with the guaranteed QoS.</p> </li> <li> <p>servations are temporary and periodically refreshed, allowing the network to adapt to changing conditions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>now let\u2019s talk about some Key Features and Benefits: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Quality of Service (QoS): Ensures consistent network performance for critical applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Receiver-Oriented: Protocols like RSVP are typically initiated by the receiver, allowing for flexible and efficient resource management.</p> </li> <li> <p>Supports Unicast and Multicast: Resource reservation can be used for both one-to-one and one-to-many communications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Temporary and Adaptive: Reservations are not permanent; they are updated or released as application needs change.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#network-efficiency","title":"Network Efficiency","text":"<p>Network efficiency refers to how effectively a network achieves its goals of fast, reliable communication and smooth data transfer with minimal resource waste or downtime. There are 6 common terms we\u2019ve to ensure to build an efficient networking infustructure:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Throughput: The actual rate at which data is successfully transferred across the network. High throughput means    the network can move large amounts of data efficiently. Example: A video streaming service like Netflix measures throughput by how many megabits per second (Mbps) of video data are successfully delivered to viewers. If a user can stream a 4K video without buffering, the network is achieving high throughput, efficiently moving large data volumes to the end user.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bandwidth Utilization: Measures how much of the available bandwidth is being used. Efficient networks maximize usage without causing congestion or overloading links. Example: A corporate network has a 1 Gbps internet link. During peak business hours, network monitoring tools show that average usage is around 800 Mbps, meaning 80% of the available bandwidth is being used. This indicates efficient bandwidth utilization, as the link is neither underused nor overloaded, avoiding congestion and maximizing value from the investment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Latency: The time it takes for data to travel from source to destination. Lower latency is a sign of higher efficiency, especially for real-time applications. Example: Online gamers experience latency as \u201cping.\u201d If a game server is located close to the player, the round-trip time for data packets might be just 20 milliseconds (10s for data-out 10s for data-in), resulting in smooth gameplay. Higher latency (e.g., 200 ms) would cause noticeable lag, reducing efficiency for real-time applications like gaming or video calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>Packet Loss and Errors: Efficient networks minimize data loss and transmission errors, ensuring reliable delivery. Example : It can occcur due to hopping multiple nodes or routers causing data loss over the tranmission  medium.Technologies like forward error correction (FEC) help maintain high throughput and reliability even if some packets are lost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Upime and Reliability: High network efficiency is associated with minimal downtime and consistent availability of network services. Example: As an Isp provier we\u2019ve to ensure 99.99% guaranteed uptime.This means the network can\u2019t be unavailable for less than 5 minutes per year.Well that\u2019s a tough job to ensure. High network efficiency is demonstrated by minimal downtime and consistent service availability, which is critical for businesses relying on continuous connectivity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource Consumption: Efficient use of CPU, memory, and other network resources to prevent bottlenecks and ensure smooth operation. Example: A data center optimizes its server workload so that CPU and memory usage are balanced across all machines what we call the load balancer. By preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck, the network can handle more simultaneous connections and data transfers smoothly, improving overall efficiency. So as a  great engineer we have to design Horizontal and Vertical Scaling to distribute loads evenly.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"#network-congestion","title":"Network congestion","text":"<p>Network congestion occurs when the volume of data traffic exceeds the network\u2019s capacity to handle it efficiently. This typically happens when too many data packets are sent through a network node or link at the same time, overwhelming available bandwidth and resources. As a result, the network experiences degraded performance, including increased latency (delays), packet loss, jitter (variability in packet arrival times), and reduced throughput (overall data transfer rate). In one sentence - you don\u2019t have enough bandwidth .Let\u2019s imagine a scenario and try to understand it in a better way.</p> <p>Scenario: Imagine a network with 300/400 users.On a regular day, the network operates smoothly, handling emails, web browsing, and occasional video calls.However, let\u2019s imagine argentina and brazil is competeing against each other. What will happen?</p> <ul> <li> <p>The total data demand far exceeds the available network bandwidth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Routers and switches become overwhelmed, causing their buffers to fill up.</p> </li> <li> <p>As buffers overflow, packets are dropped, resulting in packet loss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Applications (especially real-time ones like video calls) experience jitter and lag.</p> </li> <li> <p>users notice significant delays in sending/receiving emails, slow file transfers, and frozen video calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some connections may time out entirely, forcing users to reconnect.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#transient-overload","title":"Transient overload","text":"<p>Transient overload in networking refers to a temporary condition where the demand on network resources (such as bandwidth, processing power, or memory) exceeds the available capacity for a short period. Unlike sustained overload, which is continuous or long-lasting, transient overload is brief and often caused by sudden spikes or bursts in network traffic. These overloads typically resolve themselves quickly as the burst subsides or as the system adapt. Example: Imagine a popular e-commerce website like alibaba during a flash sale. For most of the day, the server handles a steady stream of customer requests comfortably. However, when the sale begins at noon, thousands of users attempt to access the site and place orders at the exact same moment. Disaster may happen:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The number of incoming requests per second suddenly spikes, far exceeding the server\u2019s processing and bandwidth capacity.</p> </li> <li> <p>The server\u2019s request queues fill up rapidly, and some requests may be dropped or delayed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Users may experience slow page loads, timeouts, or temporary inability to complete transactions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This overload lasts only a few minutes, until the initial rush subsides and the traffic returns to normal levels. BTW there are 2 Types of Transient Overload:</p> <ul> <li>Alternating Overload: The load alternates between high and low, with overload periods equal to low-load periods.</li> <li>Intermittent Overload: The load is usually low, but there are occasional, evenly spaced spikes of overload</li> </ul> <p>we\u2019ve come a long way, yay!!! now we will talk about Routing principles and how packets are being send through.</p>"},{"location":"#routing-principles-overview","title":"Routing principles overview","text":"<p>Before explaining routing and routers I\u2019d like to explain how data packets are send over the wires or a medium.</p> <p><pre><code>Sender(mac Addr1)(packets) ===NAT===&gt;&gt;&gt; router1(ip1) ===NAT===&gt;&gt;&gt; router2(ip2) ===&gt;&gt;&gt; revicer2(mac addr2)(packet recived)\n</code></pre> simple explanation :</p> <ul> <li> <p>Sender (mac Addr1): This is the main node, identified by its MAC address (mac Addr1). It sends a data packet toward the destination.</p> </li> <li> <p>NAT (at router1 with ip1): The packet first reaches router1, which uses Network Address Translation (NAT). NAT changes the packet\u2019s source IP address from the sender\u2019s private IP to router1\u2019s public IP (ip1). This hides the sender\u2019s private IP from the outside network.</p> </li> <li> <p>NAT (at router2 with ip2): The packet then reaches router2, which also uses NAT. Router2 changes the source IP address again, this time from router1\u2019s public IP (ip1) to router2\u2019s public IP (ip2). Now, to the outside world, the packet looks like it came from router2.</p> </li> <li> <p>Receiver2 (mac addr2): Finally, the packet arrives at the destination node, identified by its MAC address (mac addr2). When the response is sent back, each NAT router reverses the address translation so the reply can find its way back to the original sender.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In summary: At each NAT router, the source IP address in the packet is replaced with the router\u2019s own public IP. This process hides the internal network structure and allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address. The routers keep track of these translations so return traffic can be routed correctly back to the original sender.But the question is  do we really get the idea what router did? It just routed our package to the sender to make a transaction.Let me elaborate a detailed Routing Process Example:</p> <ul> <li>Initiation: A source node wants to send data to a destination node.</li> <li>Packet Creation: The data is divided into packets, each labeled with the destination IP address.</li> <li>Routing Table Lookup: The router checks its routing table to find the best next hop for the packet based on the shortest or least-cost path.</li> <li>Packet Forwarding: The packet is forwarded from router to router (hops) until it reaches the destination.</li> <li>Reassembly: At the destination, packets are reassembled into the original data</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#routing-principles","title":"Routing principles","text":"<p>Routing in networking is the process of selecting paths in a network along which data packets travel from a source to a destination.
